## Original Process Description
```
Material flow Browin’s supply chain is characterized by a high variety of SKUs (approx. 10,000) and significant seasonality in demand. The physical flow of materials involves two main locations: the production facility in Łódź and the external warehouse in Chocianowice. The material flow follows a push logic heavily constrained by logistics. Raw materials are stored in the Chocianowice warehouse. Twice a daily, trucks transport required materials to the production site. Finished goods are then transported back to Chocianowice or directly to distribution. This reciprocal movement of materials in large batches represents a significant transportation waste Based on the facility layout analysis , the production floor is organized in functional areas (e.g., injection molding, packaging/assembly). However, the flow is interrupted by cross-flows. The paths of raw materials and finished goods often intersect due to space constraints in the "Old" and "New" facility sections. Implemented solutions Currently, Browin operates in a hybrid environment combining legacy digital tools with manual processes: ERP & WMS: The company utilizes an ERP system and a Warehouse Management System (WMS). However, these systems are not integrated directly with the shop floor machinery. Planning strategy: Production planning is performed on a weekly basis (plans prepared on Thursdays for the following week). The forecasting horizon is limited to 3-4 weeks , driven by a management strategy to minimize inventory holding costs (max 3 months of stock). Data collection: This is a critical weak point. Production data is recorded manually on paper by operators and physically handed to team leaders, who then transcribe it into Excel spreadsheets. This "Paper → Excel" process introduces a significant time lag and data accuracy risks. Bottlenecks Based on the analysis of internal processes and interviews, we have categorized the critical constraints into three distinct levels: information flow, internal logistics, and strategic planning 1. The information gap (Data Latency): The most critical missed opportunity at Browin is the underutilization of production data. To use a classic analogy, Browin currently possesses the "oil wells" (operators generating valuable data) but lacks the pipeline to transport and refine it. The core issue is the manual "Paper to Excel" process. Operators record metrics by hand, and these are later transcribed by team leaders. This analog method creates a significant data lag. By the time the information reaches management, it is historical rather than actionable. This means the potential for real-time problem solving or dynamic scheduling is lost because decisions are always based on what happened yesterday, not what is happening right now. 2. Internal logistics (The Supply Cycle): The physical movement of materials acts as a hard brake on production capacity. We explicitly identified the time between batch changes as a primary weakness. The problem lies in the inefficient "changeover supply cycle." Machines often sit idle simply waiting for materials to be delivered from the warehouse. This downtime is not due to machine setup, but due to logistics lag. Additionally, the reciprocal movement of materials between the Chocianowice warehouse and the production site creates unnecessary transportation waste. We are moving too much material back and forth rather than delivering exactly what is needed. 3. Strategic friction (The Inventory Fear): These operational difficulties are exacerbated by a specific strategic mindset: a pervasive "fear of large inventory." This fear drives the planning department to schedule production in very small batches. While the intention is to minimize stock, this strategy artificially inflates the number of required changeovers. When you combine frequent changeovers with a slow warehouse response (identified in point 2), the result is a disproportionate loss of production time. The strategy of minimizing inventory ironically maximizes operational waste. Problem definition The definitive problem at Brow

# PROCESS ANALYSIS

### Main Steps
- **Material Storage & Transport**
  - Raw materials are kept in the Chocianowice warehouse.
  - Materials are trucked twice daily to the production facility in Łódź.
  - Finished goods are either returned to Chocianowice or sent to distribution.
- **Production Flow**
  - The production floor is functionally divided (e.g., injection molding, packaging/assembly).
  - Material flows are interrupted by cross-traffic and space constraints between “Old” and “New” facility sections.
- **Data Handling**
  - Production data is recorded manually on paper by operators.
  - Paper records are physically transferred to team leaders.
  - Team leaders then transcribe data into Excel spreadsheets.
- **Planning & Forecasting**
  - Production planning is weekly, based on a 3-4 week horizon.
  - Inventory holding is capped at a maximum of 3 months.

### Key Bottlenecks
- **Information Flow Delay**
  - Manual “Paper → Excel” data transcribing causes significant time lags and accuracy risks, making production data historical rather than actionable.
- **Internal Logistics Inefficiency**
  - Inefficient batch changes and logistics lag cause machine downtime; excess reciprocal material movements create transportation waste.
- **Strategic Planning Constraints**
  - Small-batch scheduling to minimize inventory inflates changeovers, exacerbating downtime due to slow logistics.
- **Physical Flow Interruptions**
  - Facility layout with intersecting flows and space constraints creates congestion and inefficiency.

### Tools Used
- ERP and WMS (not integrated with shop floor machinery)
- Microsoft Excel (for data transcription)
- Manual processes (paper-based collection)
- Trucks for transportation between sites

### Missing Information
- Detailed ERP/WMS capabilities and integration
- Production volumes and transport logistics
- Labor allocation and responsibilities
- Detailed facility layout and downtime/changeover analytics
- SKU prioritization and dynamic distribution decisions

# OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS

## Automation & Integration

- **Automate Production Data Collection**
  - Replace paper logs with digital data entry on tablets or industrial touchscreens.
  - Integrate shop floor data capture directly with a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) or MES-like module in ERP/WMS.
  - Employ barcode/RFID scanning for real-time tracking of material movement and production output.

- **ERP/WMS Integration**
  - Integrate ERP and WMS with real-time shop floor systems for seamless inventory updates and internal transport requests.
  - Introduce automated material release and transport scheduling to align with production needs.

- **Planning & Scheduling Automation**
  - Implement Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) modules, integrated with actual shop floor and warehouse data.
  - Enable rolling-horizon or near real-time adjustments using live inventory and demand data.

## Physical & Internal Logistics Improvement

- **Move Toward Pull-Based Flow**
  - Shift from batch-based push scheduling to pull-based, demand-driven (e.g., digital Kanban signals).
  - Adjust transport logic to respond dynamically to real production needs, minimizing idle time and transportation waste.

- **Automate Internal Material Movement**
  - Deploy automated material handling solutions such as AGVs (Automated Guided Vehicles) or tugger trains within the facility.
  - Redesign internal drop zones to minimize cross-traffic and flow interruptions where layout adjustments are feasible.

## Elimination of Redundant Steps

- Eliminate manual transcription by capturing operator data directly into digital systems.
- Phase out physical paper storage in favor of centralized digital records with built-in audit trails.
- Reduce batch logistics and unnecessary material handling by improving scheduling visibility and responsiveness.

## Ownership & Governance

- Assign IT/automation teams to drive digital data capture and system integration.
- Appoint a Digital Transformation Lead to oversee ERP/WMS/MES integration.
- Clarify production, warehouse, and planning roles for data integrity and continuous improvement.
- Appoint a Lean Champion or Process Engineer to track ongoing KPI improvements post-digitalization.

## Feasibility and Constraints

- Assess current ERP/WMS system integration capabilities and required middleware.
- Consider phased implementation, starting with high-ROI automation (e.g., production data capture).
- Upgrade facility networks (Wi-Fi/IT infrastructure) for real-time shop floor connectivity if necessary.
- Invest in workforce training and change management for smooth digital adoption.
