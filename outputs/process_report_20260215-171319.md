## Full Report

## PROCESS ANALYSIS

- **Process Steps:**
  - Tasks are initiated through either digital tools or manual triggers.
  - Data (orders, requests, information) is collected via both digital forms and paper-based methods.
  - Staff process or transfer information, switching between digital and manual workflows depending on the data source.
  - Approvals or reviews are conducted digitally (email or legacy systems) and manually (signatures, physical stamps).
  - Post-approval actions involve updating systems and/or manual record-keeping.
  - Final results are communicated and documented using both digital and manual tools.

- **Bottlenecks:**
  - Delays from manual transcription of data between paper and digital systems.
  - Approval processes often slow down waiting for physical signatures or document routing.
  - Errors and rework occur due to duplicate data entry and poor system integration.
  - Difficulty tracking task status due to fragmented records.
  - Risk of document loss or misplacement leading to delays.

- **Tools Involved:**
  - Legacy digital systems (old CRM, ERP, workflow tools)
  - Manual/paper forms, physical documentation
  - Email for approvals and communications
  - Basic office software (Word, Excel)
  - Scanners/fax machines for digitizing documents

- **Missing Information:**
  - Specific systems in use, volume of tasks, personnel details, process frequency, security needs, reasons for manual steps, integration levels, and performance metrics .

## OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS

- **Automation Opportunities:**
  - Use OCR tools (e.g., ABBYY FlexiCapture, Power Automate AI Builder) to digitize and automatically extract data from physical documents, reducing transcription needs.
  - Implement workflow automation platforms (e.g., Microsoft Power Automate, Nintex) that can route approvals, enforce rules, and notify stakeholders, removing paper-based routing.
  - Utilize RPA bots (e.g., UiPath, Automation Anywhere) for automatic data validation against business rules, reducing error rates.
  - Deploy a centralized digital document management system (e.g., SharePoint, M-Files) for version control, document search, and audit trails.
  - Integrate legacy systems using middleware or APIs so that data flows seamlessly, minimizing manual data reentry.

- **Elimination of Redundant Steps:**
  - Remove manual re-entry of the same data by automating data capture.
  - Replace email-based tracking of tasks with automated dashboards and status alerts.
  - Consolidate duplicative approval chains, removing unnecessary sign-offs.
  - Eliminate physical document handling for signatures through authenticated e-signature solutions and digital routing.

- **Clearer Process Ownership:**
  - Assign roles for document scanning/OCR validation (e.g., data entry specialist).
  - Designate a Workflow Owner to oversee digital approvals and exception handling.
  - Make IT or a transformation lead responsible for integration and automation tools.
  - Charge a Compliance Officer or Document Controller with oversight of document management and audit requirements.

- **Feasibility Constraints:**
  - Technical: Limitations in legacy system integration may require custom tools or a phased approach.
  - Organizational: Successful automation requires staff training and change management support.
  - Cost: Upfront investments in OCR, RPA, document management, and integrations.
  - Security & Compliance: Ensure digital solutions comply with privacy and security requirements.
  - Incremental Rollout: Begin with highest-impact areas (e.g., document intake, approvals), then expand as capacity allows .
