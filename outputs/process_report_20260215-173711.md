## Original Process Description
```
Material flow Browin’s supply chain is characterized by a high variety of SKUs (approx. 10,000) and significant seasonality in demand. The physical flow of materials involves two main locations: the production facility in Łódź and the external warehouse in Chocianowice. The material flow follows a push logic heavily constrained by logistics. Raw materials are stored in the Chocianowice warehouse. Twice a daily, trucks transport required materials to the production site. Finished goods are then transported back to Chocianowice or directly to distribution. This reciprocal movement of materials in large batches represents a significant transportation waste Based on the facility layout analysis , the production floor is organized in functional areas (e.g., injection molding, packaging/assembly). However, the flow is interrupted by cross-flows. The paths of raw materials and finished goods often intersect due to space constraints in the "Old" and "New" facility sections. Implemented solutions Currently, Browin operates in a hybrid environment combining legacy digital tools with manual processes: ERP & WMS: The company utilizes an ERP system and a Warehouse Management System (WMS). However, these systems are not integrated directly with the shop floor machinery. Planning strategy: Production planning is performed on a weekly basis (plans prepared on Thursdays for the following week). The forecasting horizon is limited to 3-4 weeks , driven by a management strategy to minimize inventory holding costs (max 3 months of stock). Data collection: This is a critical weak point. Production data is recorded manually on paper by operators and physically handed to team leaders, who then transcribe it into Excel spreadsheets. This "Paper → Excel" process introduces a significant time lag and data accuracy risks. Bottlenecks Based on the analysis of internal processes and interviews, we have categorized the critical constraints into three distinct levels: information flow, internal logistics, and strategic planning 1. The information gap (Data Latency): The most critical missed opportunity at Browin is the underutilization of production data. To use a classic analogy, Browin currently possesses the "oil wells" (operators generating valuable data) but lacks the pipeline to transport and refine it. The core issue is the manual "Paper to Excel" process. Operators record metrics by hand, and these are later transcribed by team leaders. This analog method creates a significant data lag. By the time the information reaches management, it is historical rather than actionable. This means the potential for real-time problem solving or dynamic scheduling is lost because decisions are always based on what happened yesterday, not what is happening right now. 2. Internal logistics (The Supply Cycle): The physical movement of materials acts as a hard brake on production capacity. We explicitly identified the time between batch changes as a primary weakness. The problem lies in the inefficient "changeover supply cycle." Machines often sit idle simply waiting for materials to be delivered from the warehouse. This downtime is not due to machine setup, but due to logistics lag. Additionally, the reciprocal movement of materials between the Chocianowice warehouse and the production site creates unnecessary transportation waste. We are moving too much material back and forth rather than delivering exactly what is needed. 3. Strategic friction (The Inventory Fear): These operational difficulties are exacerbated by a specific strategic mindset: a pervasive "fear of large inventory." This fear drives the planning department to schedule production in very small batches. While the intention is to minimize stock, this strategy artificially inflates the number of required changeovers. When you combine frequent changeovers with a slow warehouse response (identified in point 2), the result is a disproportionate loss of production time. The strategy of minimizing inventory ironically maximizes operational waste. Problem definition The definitive problem at Brow

PROCESS ANALYSIS

Process Steps
1. Raw materials are delivered and stored in the Chocianowice warehouse.
2. Twice daily, required raw materials are transported by truck from Chocianowice to the Łódź production facility.
3. Materials are moved to the corresponding functional areas on the production floor (e.g., injection molding, packaging/assembly).
4. Production operators manually record process data on paper.
5. Paper records are physically given to team leaders.
6. Team leaders transcribe production data from paper into Excel spreadsheets.
7. Finished goods are transported either back to the Chocianowice warehouse or directly to distribution.

Bottlenecks
1. Data latency due to manual "Paper → Excel" process, causing delayed and less actionable information for management.
2. Internal logistics delays, particularly machine idle time during material changeovers caused by slow warehouse response and inefficient supply cycles.
3. Transportation waste from reciprocal large-batch material movement between warehouse and production site.
4. High frequency of changeovers due to a strategy to minimize inventory, leading to excessive downtime and operational inefficiency.
5. Cross-flows and intersecting material/finished goods paths on the production floor, creating physical flow interruptions.

Tools Involved
1. ERP system (not directly integrated with shop floor machinery).
2. Warehouse Management System (WMS) (not directly integrated with shop floor machinery).
3. Excel spreadsheets for data recording and analysis.
4. Manual (paper-based) data collection and recording by operators.
5. Trucks for material transportation between warehouse and production facility.

Missing Information
1. Detailed workflow for handling and storing finished goods at Chocianowice and their preparation for distribution.
2. Specific ERP and WMS software brands and any automation features they might provide.
3. Quantitative data on average changeover times and machine idle durations due to logistics delays.
4. Information on how production priorities or schedules are adjusted in response to real-time problems or exceptions.
5. Number and type of production machines and their dependencies on material flows.
6. Organizational structure, including responsibility for process improvement initiatives.
7. Details regarding existing or planned automation/digitization projects for data collection and integration.

OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS

Automation Opportunities
- Implement digital data capture on the shop floor (e.g., tablets or industrial touchscreens) for operators to directly enter process data, eliminating paper records and manual transcription. This data should be integrated with the ERP system using middleware or MES (Manufacturing Execution System) software.
- Integrate ERP and WMS systems with automated material call-off, using real-time inventory and production needs to trigger deliveries and reduce manual requests and delays.
- Use barcode/RFID technology for tracking material and finished goods movement, improving visibility and reducing manual handling errors.
- Deploy automated guided vehicles (AGVs) or conveyors for material movement within the production floor to minimize cross-flows and improve physical flow efficiency.

Elimination of Redundant Steps
- Remove paper-based recording of production data and the subsequent manual handoff to team leaders. Data should be entered once, digitally, and flow automatically into required reports.
- Eliminate batch-based, reciprocal truck movement by shifting to smaller, more frequent deliveries, potentially leveraging just-in-time principles integrated via IT systems.

Clearer Ownership
- Warehouse Manager: Responsible for raw material flow, communication with production, and timely deliveries to production facility.
- Production Operators: Accountable for accurate and timely digital data entry of process metrics at the source.
- Production Team Leaders: Oversee process execution, monitor digital data quality, and support operators in resolving exceptions.
- IT/Automation Lead: Owns the integration and maintenance of ERP, WMS, and any new digital/MES/automation solutions.
- Logistics Coordinator: Manages transportation scheduling and monitors internal flow efficiency between sites.

Feasibility Constraints
- Legacy equipment may limit direct integration with MES/ERP without interface modules or middleware; additional investment may be required.
- Upfront costs and change management challenges associated with digitization (hardware, software licensing, retraining staff).
- Resistance to process changes from frontline staff and existing management practices.
- Limited data on baseline changeover times and logistics performance may hinder prioritization and ROI justification for automation projects.
- Current organizational structure may lack process improvement ownership, requiring change management or dedicated roles.
