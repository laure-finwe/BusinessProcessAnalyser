  "process_description": "Material flow Browin’s supply chain is characterized by a high variety of SKUs (approx. 10,000) and significant seasonality in demand. The physical flow of materials involves two main locations: the production facility in Łódź and the external warehouse in Chocianowice. The material flow follows a push logic heavily constrained by logistics. Raw materials are stored in the Chocianowice warehouse. Twice a daily, trucks transport required materials to the production site. Finished goods are then transported back to Chocianowice or directly to distribution. This reciprocal movement of materials in large batches represents a significant transportation waste Based on the facility layout analysis , the production floor is organized in functional areas (e.g., injection molding, packaging/assembly). However, the flow is interrupted by cross-flows. The paths of raw materials and finished goods often intersect due to space constraints in the \"Old\" and \"New\" facility sections. Implemented solutions Currently, Browin operates in a hybrid environment combining legacy digital tools with manual processes: ERP & WMS: The company utilizes an ERP system and a Warehouse Management System (WMS). However, these systems are not integrated directly with the shop floor machinery. Planning strategy: Production planning is performed on a weekly basis (plans prepared on Thursdays for the following week). The forecasting horizon is limited to 3-4 weeks , driven by a management strategy to minimize inventory holding costs (max 3 months of stock). Data collection: This is a critical weak point. Production data is recorded manually on paper by operators and physically handed to team leaders, who then transcribe it into Excel spreadsheets. This \"Paper → Excel\" process introduces a significant time lag and data accuracy risks. Bottlenecks Based on the analysis of internal processes and interviews, we have categorized the critical constraints into three distinct levels: information flow, internal logistics, and strategic planning 1. The information gap (Data Latency): The most critical missed opportunity at Browin is the underutilization of production data. To use a classic analogy, Browin currently possesses the \"oil wells\" (operators generating valuable data) but lacks the pipeline to transport and refine it. The core issue is the manual \"Paper to Excel\" process. Operators record metrics by hand, and these are later transcribed by team leaders. This analog method creates a significant data lag. By the time the information reaches management, it is historical rather than actionable. This means the potential for real-time problem solving or dynamic scheduling is lost because decisions are always based on what happened yesterday, not what is happening right now. 2. Internal logistics (The Supply Cycle): The physical movement of materials acts as a hard brake on production capacity. We explicitly identified the time between batch changes as a primary weakness. The problem lies in the inefficient \"changeover supply cycle.\" Machines often sit idle simply waiting for materials to be delivered from the warehouse. This downtime is not due to machine setup, but due to logistics lag. Additionally, the reciprocal movement of materials between the Chocianowice warehouse and the production site creates unnecessary transportation waste. We are moving too much material back and forth rather than delivering exactly what is needed. 3. Strategic friction (The Inventory Fear): These operational difficulties are exacerbated by a specific strategic mindset: a pervasive \"fear of large inventory.\" This fear drives the planning department to schedule production in very small batches. While the intention is to minimize stock, this strategy artificially inflates the number of required changeovers. When you combine frequent changeovers with a slow warehouse response (identified in point 2), the result is a disproportionate loss of production time. The strategy of minimizing inventory ironically maximizes operational waste. Problem definition The definitive problem at Brow",

Production flow is disrupted by cross-flows and intersecting paths due to facility constraints.\n- **Production Data Collection**\n  - Operators record data manually on paper.\n- **Data Transcription**\n  - Team leaders transcribe paper records into Excel spreadsheets.\n- **Finished Goods Transportation**\n  - Finished goods are sent either back to Chocianowice or directly to distribution.\n- **Production Planning**\n  - Weekly planning (done on Thursdays for the following week), short forecasting horizon (3–4 weeks).\n- **Inventory Strategy**\n  - Small batch production to minimize inventory (maximum 3 months' stock).\n\n## Bottlenecks\n\n- **Data Latency and Manual Collection**\n  - The \"Paper → Excel\" process creates significant delays and data accuracy risks. Decision-making is always based on outdated data.\n- **Internal Logistics Delays**\n  - Machines are frequently idle while waiting for materials due to inefficient “changeover supply cycle.”\n- **Transportation Waste**\n  - Reciprocal, large-batch movements of materials between warehouse and production represent significant transportation waste.\n- **Cross-Flows and Space Constraints**\n  - Material paths for raw and finished goods cross due to space limitations in “Old” and “New” plant sections, causing additional inefficiency.\n- **Strategic Friction from Inventory Policy**\n  - An extreme fear of inventory holdings results in excessive changeovers and downtime, increasing overall operational waste.\n\n## Tools Involved\n\n- ERP & WMS (not integrated with shop floor equipment)\n- Manual paper records\n- Excel spreadsheets\n- Trucks for material and product movement\n\n---\n\n# OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n## 1. Digital Integration & Data Automation\n\n- **Implement a Manufacturing Execution System (MES):**\n  - Use tablets or industrial touch screens at workstations for real-time, direct data entry.\n  - Integrate MES with ERP/WMS for seamless information flow.\n- **Automate Data Collection:**\n  - Employ IoT sensors for machine status/production counts, reducing reliance on manual entry.\n  - Eliminate paper records and secondary Excel transcription.\n- **Benefits:** Drastically reduces latency, enables real-time decision-making, increases accuracy, and sets foundation for analytics and dynamic scheduling.\n\n## 2. Logistics and Material Flow Optimization\n\n- **Introduce Pull-Based Logistics:**\n  - Move toward Kanban or “supermarket” systems, where material deliveries are triggered by actual production needs, not prescheduled batches.\n  - Frequency and batch sizes should adapt dynamically, reducing surplus movements.\n- **Automate/Streamline Internal Transport:**\n  - If feasible, add AGVs (Automated Guided Vehicles) or conveyors for material transfer between warehouse and production floor.\n  - Barcoding/RFID for real-time inventory and location tracking.\n- **Benefits:** Reduces machine idle times, transportation waste, and facilitates smoother/more predictable flows.\n\n## 3.
