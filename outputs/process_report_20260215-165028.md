# Business Process Automation Report

**Date:** 2026-02-15 16:50:28

## Original Process Description
```
The current employee onboarding process starts when HR receives a signed offer letter. 
HR manually enters the new hire's details into an Excel spreadsheet and sends an email to IT to request a laptop and software access. 
IT receives the email and creates a ticket in their legacy system, then provisions the laptop. 
Meanwhile, HR emails Facilities to request a desk and badge. Facilities checks the desk availability manually and replies to HR with the desk number and badge status. 
HR then compiles all information (IT setup, desk assignment, badge) and sends a welcome email to the new hire with instructions. 
The entire process takes 3-5 days on average, but delays often occur because IT and Facilities take 1-2 days to respond, and there is no central tracking. 
Sometimes information is lost in email threads, requiring follow-ups. 
HR also has to manually verify that all steps are completed before sending the welcome email. 
There is no formal checklist or system to track progress, so HR relies on memory and email trails.

# PROCESS ANALYSIS

**Process Steps**
- HR receives a signed offer letter.
- HR manually enters new hire details into an Excel spreadsheet.
- HR sends an email to IT to request a laptop and software access.
- IT receives the email and creates a ticket in their legacy system.
- IT provisions the laptop.
- HR emails Facilities to request desk and badge.
- Facilities checks desk availability manually and replies to HR with desk number and badge status.
- HR compiles information (IT setup, desk assignment, badge) from IT and Facilities.
- HR sends a welcome email with instructions to the new hire.

**Bottlenecks**
- Manual entry of new hire details into Excel (time-consuming and error-prone).
- Reliance on email communication for requests/updates leads to lost or delayed information.
- IT and Facilities typically take 1-2 days to respond due to no prioritization or SLAs.
- No central tracking system; HR manually follows up and verifies completion of tasks.
- HR relies on memory and email trails rather than a formal checklist.
- Process completion time averages 3-5 days, with frequent delays.
- Risk of missing or incomplete onboarding steps due to lack of process visibility.

**Tools Involved**
- Excel spreadsheet (HR’s record-keeping).
- Email (HR, IT, and Facilities communication).
- IT’s legacy ticketing system (for laptop provisioning).
- Manual Facilities desk availability checking (unclear method).

**Missing Information**
- Details and capabilities of the IT legacy ticketing system.
- Software/system access approval workflow details.
- Escalation process for overdue responses from IT/Facilities.
- Onboarding process volumes (number of hires).
- Facilities’ desk/badge tracking method.
- Any available automation or workflow tools.
- Role of vendors/external parties in badge/desk assignments.
- Digital storage process for signed offer letters.
- Frequency and method of follow-up on incomplete tasks.
- Existence of compliance/background checks in onboarding.

# OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS

**Automation Opportunities**
- Implement a central HRIS/onboarding platform (e.g., Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, BambooHR) to capture new hire details, automating the data transfer and eliminating manual Excel entry.
- Integrate Microsoft Forms or Google Forms with automation tools (e.g., Power Automate, Zapier) as a low-code alternative to automate data collection and sharing.
- Use workflow automation tools (e.g., ServiceNow, Jira Service Management) for HR to trigger onboarding requests for IT and Facilities, removing the need for email.
- Automatically generate and route IT and Facilities tickets/requests from the HRIS or onboarding portal.
- Create a cross-department onboarding checklist within the HRIS or project management tool (e.g., Monday.com, Asana) to track status and trigger notifications/escalations for overdue tasks.
- Automate the welcome email using templates triggered by task completion in the HRIS or workflow system.

**Elimination of Redundant Steps**
- Remove manual Excel entry by automating data capture via forms/HRIS.
- Eliminate separate emails to IT and Facilities by centralizing requests/tickets and visibility.
- Replace manual desk availability checks with a real-time, integrated desk assignment tool.

**Clearer Ownership**
- HR owns onboarding initiation, with the system handling data routing/checklists.
- IT and Facilities own their respective provisioning/assignments, updating status in the centralized system.
- The system/HRIS owns process tracking, reminders, and escalation.

**Feasibility Constraints**
- Adoption of a full HRIS/onboarding portal may require significant technical integration.
- Small organizations might benefit from low-code automation (e.g., Power Automate, Zapier) and shared online tools rather than complete system replacement.
- Organizational change management and training are needed for all participating teams.
- Implementation costs vary from simple (online forms, project management tools) to high (full HRIS/workflow suite).

**Summary**
Implementing a central onboarding platform and workflow would automate data entry, eliminate email dependencies, improve transparency, and dramatically reduce the onboarding cycle time and error risk. Start with low-code automation or project management tools if a major system upgrade is not feasible, and ensure all steps are tracked in a centralized checklist or dashboard for process reliability and efficiency  .
